- No extract_area errors for basic method

### 3. Enhanced Watermark Removal (MAIN TEST)
❌ **FAILED** - Multiple critical bugs detected

#### Test Case 1: Small Region (10x10 pixels)
```javascript
watermarkArea: { x: 50, y: 50, width: 10, height: 10 }
```
**Result**: ❌ FAILED  
**Error**: `Input buffer contains unsupported image format`  
**Root Cause**: InpaintingEngine.processWatermarkRemoval line 81

#### Test Case 2: Medium Region (50x50 pixels)  
```javascript
watermarkArea: { x: 200, y: 200, width: 50, height: 50 }
```
**Result**: ❌ FAILED  
**Error**: `extract_area: bad extract area`  
**Root Cause**: InpaintingEngine.basicInpainting line 260

#### Test Case 3: Large Region (100x100 pixels)
```javascript
watermarkArea: { x: 150, y: 150, width: 100, height: 100 }
```
**Result**: ❌ FAILED  
**Error**: `extract_area: bad extract area`  
**Root Cause**: InpaintingEngine.basicInpainting line 260

## Specific Error Analysis

### Primary Bug: `extract_area: bad extract area`
**Frequency**: Occurred in 5 out of 7 test attempts  
**Location**: Sharp.toBuffer calls in inpainting engine  
**Affected Methods**:
- `InpaintingEngine.basicInpainting` (line 260)
- `EdgeFeatherer.detectEdges` (line 127)
- Various inpainting algorithms

### Secondary Bug: `Input buffer contains unsupported image format`
**Frequency**: Occurred in 1 out of 7 test attempts  
**Location**: InpaintingEngine.processWatermarkRemoval (line 81)  
**Issue**: Image format handling in Sharp library

## Error Handling Tests
✅ **All Passed**
- Missing imageId: Returns 400 error correctly
- Invalid coordinates: Returns 400 error correctly  
- Non-existent image: Returns 404 error correctly

## Performance Comparison

| Method | Status | Processing Time | Quality Metrics |
|--------|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Basic Watermark Removal | ✅ Working | ~51ms | Basic blur only |
| Enhanced (Advanced) | ❌ Failing | N/A | Not available due to errors |

## Detailed Error Stack Traces

### Error 1: Input Buffer Format
```
Error: Input buffer contains unsupported image format
    at Sharp.toBuffer (C:\Project\PixelPress\node_modules\sharp\lib\output.js:163:17)
    at InpaintingEngine.processWatermarkRemoval (C:\Project\PixelPress\server\src\utils\inpaintingEngine.ts:81:49)
```

### Error 2: Extract Area (Most Common)
```
Error: extract_area: bad extract area
    at Sharp.toBuffer (C:\Project\PixelPress\node_modules\sharp\lib\output.js:163:17)
    at InpaintingEngine.basicInpainting (C:\Project\PixelPress\server\src\utils\inpaintingEngine.ts:260:10)
    at EdgeFeatherer.detectEdges (C:\Project\PixelPress\server\src\utils\edgeFeatherer.ts:127:8)
```

## Test Coverage

### ✅ Tested Successfully
- [x] Image upload with correct field name
- [x] API endpoint routing (/api/remove-watermark-advanced)
- [x] Error handling for missing parameters
- [x] Error handling for invalid parameters  
- [x] Error handling for non-existent images
- [x] Basic watermark removal (control test)

### ❌ Failed to Test (Due to Bugs)
- [ ] Quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM, visualQuality, artifactLevel)
- [ ] Processing time measurement for enhanced method
- [ ] Texture complexity analysis
- [ ] Edge strength analysis  
- [ ] Custom inpainting options
- [ ] Different region sizes (small, medium, large)
- [ ] Boundary edge cases
- [ ] Method selection (PATCH_MATCH, etc.)

## Root Cause Analysis

The enhanced watermark removal API is **not functioning correctly** due to issues in the inpainting engine:

1. **Image Coordinate Validation**: The `extract_area` errors suggest that coordinates are not being properly validated or adjusted for image boundaries before being passed to Sharp
2. **Buffer Format Handling**: Some image processing operations are failing due to unsupported buffer formats
3. **Sharp Library Integration**: Multiple Sharp operations are failing, indicating improper integration with the image processing pipeline

## Recommendations for Bug Fixes

1. **Fix Coordinate Validation**:
   - Add proper bounds checking in inpainting engine
   - Ensure coordinates are within image dimensions
   - Handle edge cases where regions extend beyond image boundaries

2. **Image Format Handling**:
   - Ensure consistent image format throughout the pipeline
   - Add proper format conversion before Sharp operations
   - Validate image buffers before processing

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Add try-catch blocks around all Sharp operations
   - Provide more descriptive error messages
   - Implement fallback mechanisms

## Conclusion

**The bug is NOT fixed.** The enhanced watermark removal API endpoint contains multiple critical bugs that prevent it from functioning correctly. The `extract_area: bad extract area` error that was supposed to be resolved is still occurring consistently across different test scenarios.

**Priority**: Critical  
**Status**: Requires immediate attention  
**Impact**: Enhanced watermark removal feature is completely non-functional
