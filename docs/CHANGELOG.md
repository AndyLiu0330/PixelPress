## Development Notes

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Monorepo Structure**: Used npm workspaces for better dependency management
2. **Sharp over OpenCV**: Chose Sharp for better Node.js compatibility
3. **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript implementation for better development experience
4. **React + Vite**: Modern frontend stack for fast development and builds

### Known Limitations in v1.0
- Watermark removal uses blur technique (not AI-powered inpainting)
- Single image processing only (batch UI planned for v1.1)
- 50MB file size limit for uploads
- Temporary file storage only (cloud storage planned for v2.0)

### Testing Coverage
- Unit tests for utility functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Component tests for React components
- End-to-end workflow testing

### Security Features
- File type validation
- File size limits
- Rate limiting per IP
- Automatic file cleanup
- Input sanitization and validation
