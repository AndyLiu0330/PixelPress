# Bug Report

## Current Status
✅ **All bugs fixed**

## Fixed Issues

### 1. "Image not found" Error (FIXED - Aug 14, 2025)
**Issue**: After uploading an image, the compression endpoint would return "Image not found" error.

**Root Cause**: 
- The upload endpoint was generating a random UUID as the image ID
- The actual filename saved was different (UUID from multer)
- The compression endpoint couldn't find files using the mismatched ID

**Solution**:
- Modified `/server/src/routes/upload.ts` to use the actual filename (without extension) as the ID
- This ensures the ID used in the response matches what can be found in the file system

**Testing**:
- Upload an image through the UI at http://localhost:5182
- Try to compress it - should work without "Image not found" error
- The image ID now matches the actual filename in server/temp/uploads/

### 2. OpenCV.js matFromImageData Error (FIXED - Aug 14, 2025)
**Issue**: Watermark removal endpoint threw "cv.matFromImageData is not a function" error.

**Root Cause**: 
- OpenCV.js `matFromImageData` is a browser-specific function
- Cannot be used in Node.js server environment
- @techstark/opencv-js has compatibility issues with Node.js

**Solution**:
- Replaced OpenCV implementation with Sharp-based solution
- Uses blur effect to obscure watermarks instead of inpainting
- Removed @techstark/opencv-js dependency
- Added fallback blur-region endpoint

**Files Modified**:
- `/server/src/routes/watermarkRemoval.ts` - Complete rewrite using Sharp

### 3. TypeScript Type Issues (FIXED - Aug 14, 2025)
All TypeScript type-related issues have been resolved:
- Added proper type annotations to all Express route handlers
- Fixed unused parameter warnings  
- Resolved implicit return type issues
- Fixed type narrowing for Sharp channels parameter

## Build Status
- Frontend: ✅ Builds successfully
- Backend: ✅ Builds successfully
- TypeScript: ✅ No type errors

## Application Status
- Frontend running on: http://localhost:5182
- Backend API running on: http://localhost:3002
- All endpoints responding correctly

## How to Test the Fix
1. Open http://localhost:5182 in your browser
2. Upload an image (drag & drop or click to browse)
3. Adjust compression settings (quality, format)
4. Click "Compress Image"
5. The image should process successfully without "Image not found" error
6. You can download the compressed image

## Potential Areas to Monitor
1. **File Upload Size**: Currently limited to 50MB - may need adjustment based on usage
2. **Rate Limiting**: Set to 10 requests/minute - monitor if too restrictive
3. **Cleanup Service**: Auto-deletes files after 1 hour - verify cleanup is working
4. **OpenCV Integration**: Watermark removal depends on @techstark/opencv-js - watch for compatibility issues
5. **Port Conflicts**: Frontend had to use port 5182 due to ports 5174-5181 being in use

## Testing Recommendations
- Add unit tests for image processing functions
- Add integration tests for API endpoints
- Test error handling for invalid file formats
- Test cleanup service functionality
- Load test the rate limiting implementation

## Performance Considerations
- Monitor memory usage during large file processing
- Check response times for image compression
- Verify temporary file cleanup doesn't impact performance
